# Instructions for Using Oncoprint Data
## Overview
This notebook provides a visualization of mutation data using a heatmap. This visualization shows the presence of genetic alterations in each gene across the samples.
## Data Requirements
The data should be in CSV format with the following columns:
- **hugoGeneSymbol**: Gene symbols.
- **sampleId**: Unique identifiers for each sample.
- **alterationType**: Type of genetic alteration (e.g., mutation, amplification).
### Example CSV Structure
- hugoGeneSymbol,sampleId,alterationType
- TP53,Sample1,Mutation
- BRCA1,Sample2,Amplification
- TP53,Sample3,Mutation
## Using the Data
1. **Prepare Your Data**:
   - Ensure your data file follows the required structure.
2. **Load Your Data**:
   - Replace the placeholder filename in the code with the path to your CSV file.
3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - The notebook will generate a heatmap visualizing the genetic alterations across samples.
## Data Analysis
With this dataset, you can:
- **Identify Patterns**: Observe which genes are altered across different samples.
- **Explore Alterations**: Analyze the distribution and frequency of genetic alterations.
- **Compare Samples**: Compare alterations between different samples to find commonalities or differences.
## Code Functionality
The provided code installs the necessary libraries, loads the data, and generates a heatmap to visualize genetic alterations. The heatmap uses a color map to show the presence of alterations.
For further analysis, you can:
- Adjust the pivot table to include additional or different columns.
- Customize the heatmap to highlight specific alterations or genes.
## Additional Notes
- Ensure the CSV file path is correctly specified in the notebook.
- Review the data for completeness and accuracy before visualization.
For any questions or support, consult the library documentation or reach out to the project maintainers.
